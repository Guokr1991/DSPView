DSPView
=======

DSPView is a MATLAB framework for ultrasound B-mode, velocity, strain and elastographic processing. 
It has a simple GUI which lets you easily try different algorithms and parameters, the output
image will update in real-time. This drastically reduces the amount of time needed to find
an optimal parameter set.

Documentation
=======
A [quickstart guide](documentation/quickstart.pdf) can be found in the documentation folder.

The .m files themselves have comments, and support the default MATLAB help system ("help DSPView")

The underlaying estimators and algorithms are documented in a master's thesis,
[Intraoperative Ultrasound Strain Imaging of Brain Tumors](http://bit.ly/GNmyhO), 
for which DSPView was developed.
