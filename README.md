DSPview
=======

A MATLAB framework for ultrasound b-mode, velocity, strain and elastographic processing. 
Comes with a GUI to easily try different algorithms and parameters, the output
images are updated in real-time. This drastically reduces the amount of time needed to find
an optimal parameter set.

Documentation
=======
A [quickstart guide](documentation/quickstart.pdf) can be found in the documentation folder.

The underlaying algorithms are documented in the [Master's Thesis](http://bit.ly/GNmyhO) for which DSPview
was developed. 

The .m files themselves have comments, and support the default MATLAB help system ("help DSPview")
